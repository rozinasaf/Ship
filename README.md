# Ship

Final project of the course Advanced Topics in Programing Tel Aviv University.

In this exercise you would be required to manage a “Ship” class with “Containers”, based on the following requirements:

A “Container” is an unknown type (modeled as a Template parameter)

The “Ship” has dimensions X * Y * Height for holding containers

All containers are of same size and dimensions

Certain points on the ship may have specific restrictions stating smaller height than the max Height. In case there are no such restrictions the total containers capacity of the ship is X * Y * Height
